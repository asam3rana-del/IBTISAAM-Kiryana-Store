/**
 * Single source of truth for the "did this edit actually touch any item's
 * barcode/qty/unit/rate?" check that both [com.grocerypos.v11.RoomSaleRepository]
 * and [com.grocerypos.v11.RoomPurchaseRepository] use to decide whether an
 * edit needs to reverse+reapply stock (and, for purchases, cost) at all.
 *
 * FIX (regression guard): this used to be two near-identical private
 * `itemsUnchanged()` functions, one copy-pasted into each repository. Pure
 * logic living only inside a class that needs a Room [android.content.Context]
 * to construct meant it could never be exercised by a plain JVM unit test —
 * a future edit to either copy (e.g. "fix" the rounding, add a field to
 * compare) could silently break the "unchanged items never touch stock"
 * guarantee and no test would catch it. Pulling it out here, with no Android
 * dependency, lets [StockTouchPolicyTest] cover both call sites directly.
