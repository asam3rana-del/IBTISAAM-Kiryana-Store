// FIX (Phase 3 - Online): every ...Json() builder below stamps its payload with
// "branchId" (BranchConfigStore.current) before it's pushed to Firestore, so records from
// different branches can be told apart / filtered on pull (see SyncApi.kt).
//
// FIX (sync bug #2): previously NOTHING called db.syncQueueDao().enqueue(...) anywhere
// in the app, so sync_queue stayed empty forever no matter how many sales/customers/etc.
// were created. Below, every ...Json() builder now has a matching enqueueX() function
// that builds the JSON AND inserts the sync_queue row AND triggers a sync — in one call.
//
// Call the relevant enqueueX() right after each successful DAO insert/update, e.g.:
//
//     val newId = db.customerDao().insert(customer)
//     SyncQueueHelper.enqueueCustomer(db, customer.copy(id = newId))
//
//     db.saleDao().sale(sale)
//     db.saleDao().items(saleItems)
//     SyncQueueHelper.enqueueSale(db, sale, saleItems.size)
//
// Do this at every insert/update call site for: customers, suppliers, products, sales,
// purchases, payments, expenses, cash_transactions, users. Deletes should call
// SyncQueueHelper.enqueueDelete(db, entityType, entityId) instead.

    // was first created. Use these wrappers instead of calling the DAO methods
    // directly, wherever a balance or stock change should be visible on other devices.
    //
    // FIX (conflict-safe sync): these used to push the ABSOLUTE resulting balance/stock
    // as a plain snapshot (via enqueueCustomer/enqueueSupplier/enqueueProduct). That's
