/**
 * One line item on a purchase bill being built/edited — carries enough unit-
 * conversion context (mainUnit/secondaryUnit/tertiaryUnit + their quantities)
 * for PurchaseActivity to redo its live unit-toggle math on an edit/scan/draft
 * reload without re-querying the product.
 *
 * [itemName] is what gets snapshotted onto the saved PurchaseItem row (see
 * PurchaseItem.itemName's comment in Database.kt) so History/Edit/Return
 * don't need a live product lookup to show the right name later.
 *
 * [retailRate]/[wholesaleRate]: 0.0 means "leave that product price
 * unchanged" — a nonzero value here updates the product's salePrice /
 * wholesalePrice at purchase time (see RoomPurchaseRepository.savePurchase).

/**

 * instead of touching PosDatabase directly — [RoomPurchaseRepository] is the
 * one (and only) real implementation; see that file for the actual DAO
 * calls, transaction boundaries, and the reasoning behind each FIX.
 *
 * FIX ("cannot inherit from final PurchaseRepository" — kaptGenerateStubsDebugKotlin
 * build failure): this used to be a concrete `class PurchaseRepository` with its
 * own (older, incomplete) DAO logic directly inside it — a leftover from before
 * this was split into an interface + RoomPurchaseRepository implementation.
 * Kotlin classes are final by default, so `class RoomPurchaseRepository(...) :
 * PurchaseRepository` failed to compile ("cannot inherit from final
 * PurchaseRepository"). That old class body also predated several features
 * RoomPurchaseRepository already implements (addCategory, renameUnitToEnglish,
 * updateDefaultUnitIndex, paymentsForBill, split payments, supplierInvoiceNo,
 * per-line retail/wholesale rate), so this interface is written to match
 * RoomPurchaseRepository's actual `override` members exactly, not the old
 * class's narrower set.
