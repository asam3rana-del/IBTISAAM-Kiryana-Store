    // (many items) produce a tall bitmap, and a lot of cheap 58mm ESC/POS printers
    // (Bluetooth SPP in particular) have a small internal receive/render buffer — a
    // single oversized raster command either gets truncated, prints garbled/blank, or
    // the printer just stops responding partway through. This is the most common cause
    // of "print theek nahi aata" on longer bills. The fix: split the bitmap into safe
    // horizontal strips and send them as separate GS v 0 commands, with a short pause
    // between each so the printer's buffer has time to actually print/clear before the
    // next chunk arrives.
    //
    // FIX 2 (overlapping / "double exposure" print — receipt lines printing on top of
    // each other, e.g. "Date" merging into the next line, item names showing as
    // garbled/tangled marks): real-world testing on a customer's printer showed this
    // STILL happening with the original 200px/40ms values, and even after the first
    // round of tuning (80px / 3ms-per-row / 60ms floor) some units continued to
    // overlap — most visible on Urdu lines, where two overlapping cursive lines
    // produce meaningless tangled shapes instead of legible letters (this is what
    // looked like "garbled Urdu font" but was actually two strips overlapping on the
    // paper, not a font/shaping problem).
    //
    // Root cause: the printer was still physically feeding/printing strip N when
    // strip N+1 arrived, so strip N+1 started printing before the paper had advanced
    // past strip N. Three changes tighten this further:
    //   1. Smaller strips (48px instead of 80px) — even less data per raster command,
    //      so each one finishes printing/feeding faster and pacing is finer-grained.
    //   2. A larger per-row pause (6ms/row instead of 3ms/row) and a higher minimum
    //      floor (100ms instead of 60ms) — gives slower mechanical feed more margin.
    //   3. A short settle delay right after ESC_INIT (before the first strip) and
    //      right before FEED_AND_CUT (after the last strip) — some printers need a
    //      moment to finish initializing / finish their last print job before the
    //      next command is safe to send.
    // If overlap still happens on your printer, raise MS_PER_STRIP_ROW further (e.g.
    // 6f -> 9f or 12f) and/or MIN_INTER_CHUNK_DELAY_MS (e.g. 100 -> 150) — those are
    // the two knobs to tune per-printer-model. Slower prints are always safer than
    // overlapping ones.
    // SPEED TUNING: fewer, slightly larger strips means fewer separate write+flush
    // round-trips (each one has its own Bluetooth/USB overhead), which is a real
    // speed win — while the *pacing per row* (MS_PER_STRIP_ROW) still guarantees each
    // strip has fully fed through the printer before the next one lands, so the
    // anti-overlap fix from before is preserved. Only raise MAX_STRIP_HEIGHT_PX
    // further if you also see garbled/overlapping print return — smaller strips are
    // always the safer fallback.
    //
    // FIX 3 (item table now matches the on-screen preview): the ruled grid table
    // (TableRow) was replaced for the item list with borderless Row3/ItemRow lines
    // (see below), which also has the side benefit of fewer draw operations per
    // item (no grid strokes), so this doesn't fight the anti-overlap pacing above.
    // FIX 4 ("ye print aya ha" — a SHORT bill, only 1-4 items, still printed as
    // corrupted CJK/symbol garbage starting just 2-3 lines in, right after the shop
    // header, even on this printer after a full power-cycle restart): garbling on a
    // short receipt rules out the earlier "tall bitmap overruns the buffer" cause —
    // there just isn't enough data here for that. This is the printer choking on the
    // faster strip/timing values below (64px / 90ms floor / 5ms-per-row), which were
    // raised for print speed at the cost of the anti-overlap margin from FIX 2. Per
    // this file's own SPEED TUNING note ("smaller strips are always the safer
